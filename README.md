# Isabelle/HoTT

An experimental implementation of [homotopy type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory) in the interactive theorem prover [Isabelle](https://isabelle.in.tum.de/).

### Installation & Usage

Clone the contents of this repository into `<Isabelle root directory>/src/HoTT`.

To use, set Isabelle's prover to Pure in the Theories panel, and import `HoTT`.

### Collaboration

I've been flying solo on this library as part of my Masters project, and there are very many improvements and developments that have yet to be implemented, so ***collaborators are welcome!***

If you're interested in working together on any part of this do drop me a line at `joshua DOT chen AT uni-bonn DOT de`.
